# telco_churn_logisticregression
In this project I have created a model for a telecommunication company, to predict when its customers will leave for a competitor, so that they can take some action to retain the customers

I have used Logistic Regression to execute this model.

What is the difference between Linear and Logistic Regression?
While Linear Regression is suited for estimating continuous values, it is not the best tool for predicting the class of an observed data point. In order to estimate the class of a data point, we need some sort of guidance on  what would be the most probable class for that data point.For this, we use Logistic Regression.
 
Linear regression finds a function that relates a continuous dependent variable, y, to some predictors (independent variables  ùë•1 ,  ùë•2 , etc.).

Logistic Regression is a variation of Linear Regression, useful when the observed dependent variable, y, is categorical. It produces a formula that predicts the probability of the class label as a function of the independent variables.

Logistic regression fits a special s-shaped curve by taking the linear regression and transforming the numeric estimate into a probability with the following function, which is called sigmoid function ùúé 
So, briefly, Logistic Regression passes the input through the logistic/sigmoid but then treats the result as a probability 


About the dataset
We will use a telecommunications dataset for predicting customer churn. This is a historical customer dataset where each row represents one customer. The data is relatively easy to understand, and you may uncover insights you can use immediately. Typically it is less expensive to keep customers than acquire new ones, so the focus of this analysis is to predict the customers who will stay with the company.
This data set provides information to help you predict what behavior will help you to retain customers. You can analyze all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs.

The dataset includes information about:

Customers who left within the last month ‚Äì the column is called Churn
Services that each customer has signed up for ‚Äì phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
Customer account information ‚Äì how long they had been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
Demographic info about customers ‚Äì gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents

Telco Churn is a hypothetical data file that concerns a telecommunications company's efforts to reduce turnover in its customer base. Each case corresponds to a separate

Modeling (Logistic Regression with Scikit-learn)

built the model using LogisticRegression from Scikit-learn package. This function implements logistic regression and can use different numerical optimizers to find parameters, including ‚Äònewton-cg‚Äô, ‚Äòlbfgs‚Äô, ‚Äòliblinear‚Äô, ‚Äòsag‚Äô, ‚Äòsaga‚Äô solvers. 

The version of Logistic Regression in Scikit-learn, support regularization. Regularization is a technique used to solve the overfitting problem in machine learning models. C parameter indicates inverse of regularization strength which must be a positive float. Smaller values specify stronger regularization.

Confusion Matrix : (refer the notebook for visuals)
The first row is for customers whose actual churn value in test set is 1. As you can calculate, out of 40 customers, the churn value of 15 of them is 1. And out of these 15, the classifier correctly predicted 6 of them as 1, and 9 of them as 0.

It means, for 6 customers, the actual churn value were 1 in test set, and classifier also correctly predicted those as 1. However, while the actual label of 9 customers were 1, the classifier predicted those as 0, which is not very good. We can consider it as error of the model for first row.

What about the customers with churn value 0? Lets look at the second row. It looks like there were 25 customers whom their churn value were 0.

The classifier correctly predicted 24 of them as 0, and one of them wrongly as 1. So, it has done a good job in predicting the customers with churn value 0. A good thing about confusion matrix is that shows the model‚Äôs ability to correctly predict or separate the classes. In specific case of binary classifier, such as this example, we can interpret these numbers as the count of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.


Evaluation : 

jaccard index
jaccard index for accuracy evaluation. jaccard index can be defined as the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of two label sets. If the entire set of predicted labels for a sample strictly match with the true set of labels, then the subset accuracy is 1.0; otherwise it is 0.0.

log loss for evaluation:
In logistic regression, the output can be the probability of customer churn is yes (or equals to 1). This probability is a value between 0 and 1. Log loss( Logarithmic loss) measures the performance of a classifier where the predicted output is a probability value between 0 and 1.
